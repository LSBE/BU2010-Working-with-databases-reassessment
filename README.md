# BU2010 Working with databases
 
## Introduction

### Overview

This week you get to work with databases.

## Advice

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (to save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).

It's best if you **Commit early, commit often** - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. It doesn't matter if your early commits contain mistakes.  

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).

## Task Explanation

Below is today's task. We will be working with a range of skills you have learned in recent weeks. 

We will work with the phpMyAdmin system available at bu2010.bimserver2.com . Please use the bu2010_reader user as shown in class. 

## Task Explanation and Overview

Below is today's task. For this task, you need to work in the file you are currently reading. It is a Markdown file. More explanations about the Markdown syntax can be found [on this page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

* Under the heading _Your Task_ you will find several questions. 
* Please answer the questions here in this markdown file. 
* Commit
* Push your Commit(s)


**Commit early, commit often** - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. There's no problem if you commit and there's a mistake in your file or if you haven't answered all questions yet.  

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).
